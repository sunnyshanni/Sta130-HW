    "    df = pd.read_csv(url)\n",

    "  Several errors and issues were encountered during the process:\n",
    "    - **Syntax Error**: Missing a closing parenthesis in the `pd.read_csv()` function.\n",
    "    - **Typo Error**: You accidentally used `Df` instead of `df` (Python is case-sensitive).\n",
    "    - **KeyError**: The column name `Class` does not exist, and it should be `pclass`.\n",
    "\n",
    "**2. Grouping and Describing Data**\n",
    "- We discussed how `df.groupby(\"pclass\")[\"age\"].describe()` works to group the Titanic dataset by passenger class (`pclass`) and provide descriptive statistics for the `age` column.\n",
    "    - You initially encountered an `AttributeError` due to a typo (`describle()` instead of `describe()`).\n",
    "    - After fixing that typo, there was another issue due to using `class`, which is a Python keyword, causing a **SyntaxError**. This was resolved by using `\"pclass\"` as the column name.\n",
